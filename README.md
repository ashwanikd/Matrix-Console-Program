there are many algorithms for matrix operations. my program supports theb following matrix operations.

1. add
2. subtract
3. multiply

it simple is a console program written in java for matrix operations.
the matrix is always converted to form 2^n x 2^n for algorithm.
use class Matrix to create a matrix.
use functions from class MatrixOperations for different operations on matrices.
